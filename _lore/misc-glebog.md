Hope and light may very well have returned to the Land of Drakkar...

## 03-07-04
After being in seclusion for just over 3 months under the location known as Paladin Island, GLEBOG returned to the surface of Nork. It seems that one key ingredient for his potion could only be grown in that dark and damp, sea-watery cave, and moreover it required constant care to keep it from withering up. A very rare plant known only as "Taint of Madness". Why that name? Honestly ask yourself, If you had to sit in darkened chambers for 3 months to grow a plant whose roots needed salty sea water, but who's leaves you had to wash almost every hour to keep the salt crystals from building up on them, who's leaves could not see the light of day (else both sunlight and salt would cause the leaves to wither and die); when all was said and done, would you too not have a "taint of madness" about you?

Three days after his return he discovered that his laboratory had been ransacked and his list of ingredients had been stolen. He saught out his old friend Aninac and from him GLEBOG would gather a few pieces of parchment with which to write upon the list of ingredients for his potion. However, Aninac being busy with his teachings was in need of a Zap Potion. GLEBOG agreed to the price and went out in search of such an item. Going to the Giant of Frore did not prove well, however venturing forth into the lair of Dragons he found two such Zap potions. Upon making his way back to Nork (GLEBOG had also discovered the interesting travel use of a Succor Twig), he was about to make a trade for yet a third Zap potion. Just as GLEBOG was about to state the wares he had for trade, something stuck him from behind!

Darwin heard the commotion but by the time he had made it to GLEBOG's side, much blood had been lost. GLEBOG currently rests in his home in Frore with a healer by his side. Perhaps soon he shall be able to return to his quest. But for now rest is what he needs...

## 11-30-03
Rumors have been going around that GLEBOG was seen near the Leviathan Lair, and that he even helped a group of adventurers dispatch this watery beast. But what is odd about it, he has not been seen since. Was that really GLEBOG, or was it something more sinister?

## 11-13-03 
GLEBOG has been missing for close to a month now. Did this Shape have something to do with it? And why is it that none seemed to have suffered thus far? And what ever happened to GLEBOG's potion he was working on? No evidence can be found that GLEBOG even existed; save for the vague memories locked away in the minds of a few brave adventurers. Many questions; very few answers. Perhaps in the near future the mystery of what happened to GLEBOG will be revealed...

## 10-19-03 
It seems that something out there is closing in. Something powerful seems to be giving the denizens of Nork some odd power. Taunts from afar began today as many adventurers went to claim the lives of those vile beasts. All of those evil creatures fell; some to sharpened blades; some to psionics. Even GLEBOG came forth to help vanquish the Snow Beast. Soon after, the Vampires fell as did Reggie. Yes, all was made good in the land of Nork. GLEBOG has completed his atonement and now wears his gear proud again. But as suddenly as the vile beasts fell one last voice was heard. The Shape. He made a threat directly to GLEBOG that ALL shall soon suffer. It is not known when as of yet that this suffering shall begin; but then again perhaps that not knowing is the beginning of the suffering itself...

## 10-18-03 
For close to 1 month GLEBOG has been in exile. Why? It seems that on that same night he tasted Stans, he also decided to "enhance" his potion. While in the midst of that enhancement (and a slight drunken stupor) a dark figure entered the building. GLEBOG simply said that the brewery was closed and went back to work. A mere seconds later that same building was wrecked with a blast. GLEBOG turned in time to see two glowing red eyes, belonging to that dark shape. GLEBOG then fell unconscious. When he awoke the next morning he learned that Billy had been in that blast as well. To atone for his action, GLEBOG went into exile. He is out now and is trying to piece together that hazy night and discover the remaining recipe for his potion; but moreover discover who this Dark Figure is. What GLEBOG is unaware of however, is that this Dark Figure is nothing he could have ever imagined. Even in his most dismal nightmares GLEBOG has never seen an evil like this...

After dispatching the Vile Black Dragon that resided under the City built atop a mighty Volcano, GLEBOG went to sell his wares to his old friend Darwin. While there GLEBOG met up with two adventurers, Relic and Shorti. While he knew he had to return to frore to perfect his potion, the two adventurers bid him to stay and join them in "refreshments". GLEBOG declined at first, but was unable to turn down the two adventurers. When all was said and done GLEBOG slowly staggered out of the Steel Flower and made his way back to Frore. Once at the brewery he discovered his new found affection for the contents of that case in the corner... Stans was certainly a tasty substance! In this odd state he began to dabble once again with his potion. A thought crosses the mind, however. What's worse? The potion falling into the wrong hands, or the potion being dabbled with by someone who has had one to many Stans?

## 9-24-03 
It seems that GLEBOG has been on a quest to master potions. Everyone knows that Stats are a big part of survival and this is something GLEBOG has discovered as well. During his travels he met the owner of the Brewery in Frore and was granted use of it (but only after hours). Late at night GLEBOG has been seen from time to time working on some odd type of potion. What effects will it have? That is something that only GLEBOG knows, for he has been very tight-lipped about it. All that is known is that he has made use of the Essence of Strength, Wisdom, Agility, Intelligence, and Youth. But why is he so "hush-hush" about it? Perhaps he doubts his ability to craft a unique potion and simply does not want to be let down if it's effects are not what he thinks they will be. Or, perhaps, the effects are so great he does not want the potion to fall into the wrong hands...

## 9-22-03 
Almost 3 moons ago a strange Adventurer arrived in Drakkar... Who is this odd character who calls himself GLEBOG? What is his reason for being here? Those are difficult questions to answer, but anyone who has encountered him know that high adventure are only steps away!
