Volcano Town has always been a very inhospitable place to live. Thieves favored this place as the intoxicating fumes would virtually render newcomers very vulnerable to their "practice". Captain Laolyce was no different. She hired the best thieves in town to help her carry out her shady ways. Through talking with others that practiced psionics Captain Laolyce was able to find a way to have her ship travel great distances with little effort.

She had been to the town of Nork many times, and was planning a major attack, for they were the only place in the land to have two banks and a casino. Shiny gold, glistening rubies, and sparkling diamonds danced in her vision and she commanded her sailors to the coast of Nork.

Little did she know that one of her crew members was an informant of the Norken Guard. Having been warned of the impending attack the town of Nork was prepared. The waited for Captain Laolyce and her sailors to make landfall and quickly took them into custody.

It took close to two weeks to figure out what to do with them. They had not killed anyone in their failed attack, so death to the captain and crew was not a choice. They had not actually stolen anything from Nork, so cutting off the hands of each was not a choice. But the entire town agreed that the potential for them to attack again was a possibility.

The town of Nork discussed the situation with Volcano Town officials and it was decided that Volcano Town would take custody of Captain Laolyce and her crew. The decision was made to imprison the captain and her crew. However, shortly after arriving back to Volcano Town the captain and her crew attempted an escape, but were caught. It was then found that the Volcano Town prison was not strong enough to hold them and a new prison hold would need to be found.

A cave far to the southeast of Volcano Town was found suitable and the Captain and her crew were taken there. The entrance was sealed and a mighty Red Dragon was summoned forth to help guard "just in case". Many years went by and Captain Laolyce practiced her psionics on her sailors. Several of her sailors died in the process of her refining those abilities, and she slowly became a twisted shell of what she once was.

A few years ago one of her sailors managed to dig his way out and made it past the Red Dragon, and back to Volcano Town. He too had been a victim of her vile psionics. A crowd gathered around him. He made it just 5 steps into town when he fell, slowly dying... It seemed that although his captain had found a way to prolong their life, it only kept them alive in the cavern in which they were held captive. Before his life expired he spoke; "The Sea Hag waits for you..."

The Sea Hag has killed many adventurers. Her Sailors protect her from any one who enters her realm.
