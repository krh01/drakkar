Far to the south, as the windswept plains turn into fields of ice, is found a forbidding place, the land of Frore. 

Long ago, four mighty warriors took it upon themselves to rid the southernmost lands of all danger and established the City-State of Frore. They destroyed all beasts who threatening their new city, save one. The giant Snow Beast. 

The fearsome cry of this monster sliced the air on many a frigid evening. The sound terrified the townspeople into fortifying their city-state with double walls and Golden Dragons. Fear of the Snow Beast made the citizens prisoners within their own homes. 

These citizens pleaded with the four warriors who had brought them into this possessed land. The Four, as they had come to be known, agreed. Each sought a way to destroy the vile Snow Beast. One sought the seclusion of the Northern Caves. Another built a fortress west of the city. A third excavated a complex to the south. The last built a castle directly above the city proper. 

The Four became fanatical in their quests, slipping deeper and deeper into madness and despair. One strayed too close to the forces of Evil and became a mere shadow of his former humanity. Another made a fearsome pact with the Queen of Wyrms. The third designed a weapon of such evil that it drove him from the forces of Light. The last went insane. 

Now the lands of Frore exist as a shattered kingdom. Its citizens live in fear of the Snow Beast and of the Four who were meant to save them. 

Between these vestiges of a once great civilization are vast and dangerous lands inhabited by Griffons, Dragons, Vampires and more. These guard their captured treasurers covetously.
