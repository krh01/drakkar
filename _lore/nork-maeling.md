Burning with the ambition of youth, seven Martial Artists left Nork long ago seeking adventure. They traveled for many years facing fierce and exotic creatures before finally coming upon a gentle and prosperous valley. There, they built Maeling in honor of their Dojo in Nork. 

Inside the fortified walls of the city, the streets are dark but full of small shops and secret gardens. The walled pathway, etched with griffons and brightly colored dragons, follows the edge of the buildings, adding protection against the untamed creatures that roam outside. 

After many years the travelers longed for a glimpse of the city of their youth. They called upon the strongest Mentalist in the land to teleport them home to Nork. Wisely, they also requested a way to return home to Maeling. The Mentalist constructed in Nork a Portal so they could return home. Unfortunately, the Portal was flawed and could only be used one way. 

Maeling is an exotic city and the shops sell unusual wares. Outside the fortified wall of the city, a forest leans back against mountains, honeycombed with caves. Strange beasts inhabit the Maeling wilderness, where only the very brave and skillful survive.
