Far to the East of Nork, only Volcano Town remains of a once proud and peaceful land. Now it's dark spires tower above a hot and sulfurous sea. Volcano Town is numbingly hot and dry, and adventurers, disoriented from the heat, often fall from the cliffs into the sea. A large well in the center of town emits noxious fumes, and the constant threat of volcanic eruption has deterred many merchants from opening shops.
