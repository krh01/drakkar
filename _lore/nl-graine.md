Graine. Just the name itself is reason to make small children unable to sleep; their parents as well for that matter. This vile user of dark psionics is, as the rumor goes, the one that transformed the Drakkar into what she is today; a multi-limbed, half human/half snake monstrosity. Rumors say that he was her lover scorned; others say he was her brother, jealous of the affection that their parents showed her and not him. Another rumor talks of Graine's alliance with the Sea Hag for his quest of power. Of course those are just rumors...

Graine's past is shrouded in mystery. What is known is that he comes from a far away land, yet undiscovered by the inhabitants of Nork. Few in Aleria have heard of him, and those in Cobrahn feel he might have taken up residence there recently. 

Graine seems to be a powerful psionicist, and has the power to learn at an advanced rate. He has yet to be seen in any physical form, but his taunts can be heard, spanning across the lands of Nork, through the lands of Aleria and in the great reaches of Cobrahn. He threatens that he is refining his disciplines and will soon emerge somewhere in the land of Cobrahn to wreak havoc and destroy everything that moves. 

No one is quite sure of his past or his agenda for the future. Perhaps after his first appearance more will be learned about his past. All that is known is that soon he will make his mark.

More revealed...

Graine is a crafty one. It seems that he can take many forms. It appears that he has learned a great deal over the past month. In fact, it looks as if he made himself very well known exactly one month after his initial History was made known to the inhabitants of Drakkar...
What have we learned in that time? 
He wears two different things... A simple wool cloak and some type of leather armor from a far away land...

On the eve of his appearance, that mysterious creature called Graine, took down but a small handful of adventurers brave enough to step foot into his lair. However, he himself was also thrown down and slain by a powerful Martial Artist. Yet, Graine came back! Almost as if in disbelief he attempted to again destroy those that slew him. One or two more adventurers fell to his darkened psionic craft, but again the thing known as Graine was taken down. 

Once more did he return to his lair only to see a mighty barbarian standing guard over the empty shell that Graine called home. Graine made a few feeble attempts to destroy this Barbarian, but was again drawn down. Graine returned for one last attempt, but the barbarian proved to be quite strong. Before Graine could fall again, he took to the shadows of his lair and quietly licked his wounds, and started the slow process to regain his power.

He knew that soon things would change and the elements would then be in his favor; and on his side. He knew that soon he would need to find a stray barbarian and learn the ways of brute force. He also knew that soon he would need to go forth and find something else to wear other than a simple seldari leather tunic.

But in the darkness of his lair he had a thought...
What if...
What if the dark powers in Cobrahn were to help him...
Perhaps if he were to visit some of these dark powers he could offer his services to them, and in exchange they might help him on his next encounter with these adventurers...

He knew that the journey through the swamps would be a difficult one, and venturing into the halls of the giants would be equally difficult. He knew also, that venturing forth to the castle would be a challenge. He knew that trying to visit any of the dark powers in Cobrahn might be a dauntless task, but, if he could but show them a sample of his power...

Yes, in the darkness of his chamber Graine cleaned his wounds and prepared to make a perilous journey...
