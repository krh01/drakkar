When rolling a character, the primary difference in race is the stats you can roll.

It is suggested to prioritize rolling LUK and CHA since the other stats are more easily fixable.

Here are what each race can roll at max:

Race/Stat           | STR  | INT  | WIS  | WILL | CON  | AGI  | CHA  | LUK
----                | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
City Dweller        | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18
Woodlands Dweller   | 17   | 19   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18
Forest Dweller      | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 17
Outcast             | 19   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 19   | 19   | 16   | 18
Mountain Dweller    | 19   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 17   | 18
Underground Dweller | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 18   | 15   | 12

There are also some hidden benefits to each race. While some are confirmed and others are dubious, here are a firm list of benefits per race:

* Outcast: +2 ATK
* Woodlands Dweller: EP Regen Bonus
