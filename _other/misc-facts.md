There's a lotta weird, hidden, or otherwise tough to understand things in Drakkar. Here's a brief listing of things that lots of people might ask.

* In addition to stripping, some lairs can eat. This is mostly creatures like dragons, FoodGuardian, and others. Getting eaten doesn't happen every time, but it can suck your XP and skills.

* Luck is used to determine the number of times you can buy HP from the HP doc before he asks for an item.

* Charisma is used to determine the cost of HP from the HP doc.

* Charisma is used to determine how effective paid skill training is.

* Different weapons carry different hide penalties. If you're holding a halberd, you're more likely to be seen than if you're holding a dagger.

* Strength affects how well you hit enemies, how hard you hit, and your encumberance limit.

* Agility affects how well you dodge hits and how well you hide/steal.

* Willpower affects how well you mitigate stuns.

* Constitution affects your chances of getting a higher HP rest (higher con = better rest).
