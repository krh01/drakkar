There's a lotta weird, hidden, or otherwise tough to understand things in Drakkar. Here's a brief listing of things that lots of people might ask.

## Stats

* Luck is used to determine the number of times you can buy HP from the HP doc before he asks for an item.

* Charisma is used to determine the cost of HP from the HP doc.

* Charisma is used to determine how effective paid skill training is.

* Strength affects how well you hit enemies, how hard you hit, and your encumberance limit.

* Agility affects how well you dodge hits and how well you hide/steal.

* Willpower affects how well you mitigate psi damage.

* Constitution affects your chances of getting a higher HP rest (higher con = better rest).

* Constitution affects your chances of mitigating combat stuns.

* Intelligence gives better EP rests and EP regen to Mentalists and Fighter/Mentalists.

* Wisdom gives better EP rests and EP regen to Healers.

* Attacks gives you more rolls to determine how hard you hit with a melee attack (the highest roll is kept).

## Skills

* There are some capped skills while progressing. This means that you can only get a certain number of skill gain, max, at a time. The skills are: 5, 11, 18, 26

## Disciplines

* The Aid disc boosts your ability to hide, see through hide, and your melee to-hit rolls.

* `form illusion rockwall` triggers the Cavern Creeper quirk.

* `form illusion dense|l-forest|r-forest` triggers the Tree Hugger quirk.

* You can `form illusion wall` then `form illusion water` on the wall to create an unbreakable wall that you can `passwall` onto and easily crush melee bosses.

* If you accidentally step into the open while hidden, you can manually type a movement command to get next to a wall again before your hide breaks.

## Quirks

* Innate Armor, when 100/100, adds as much AC as the Paladin Nameless Lord Armor.

## Progress Quest Evasion

* You can turn in a tied (to someone else) mormar/shimok book.

* You can skip the 50-advancement quest and just go primal.

## Miscellaneous

* Most lairs can see through Limited Invisibility (liminv).

* Different weapons carry different hide penalties. If you're holding a halberd, you're more likely to be seen than if you're holding a dagger.

* Any class can backstab and hide as if they were a thief, provided they have the requisite skill level.

* In addition to stripping, some lairs can eat. This is mostly creatures like dragons, FoodGuardian, and others. Getting eaten doesn't happen every time, but it can suck your XP and skills.

* You can be randomly stripped by monsters, they may rarely search your corpse for gear.

* Dying on a healer (via a player, or yourself) will restore your CON to the highest value it has ever been.

* Going to the level 13 HP Doc and saying `###, train` will show you your base HP.

* You can see your base EP by drinking a zap from UGH.

* Holding the corpse of some lairs will prevent them from respawning.

* If you have a skill >= 40, you can `look at xxx` to see how far they are percentwise on that skill.

* You can only gain skill in areas where you'd normally be able to get xp.
