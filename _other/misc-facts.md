There's a lotta weird, hidden, or otherwise tough to understand things in Drakkar. Here's a brief listing of things that lots of people might ask.

## Stats

* Luck is used to determine the number of times you can buy HP from the HP doc before he asks for an item.

* Charisma is used to determine the cost of HP from the HP doc.

* Charisma is used to determine how effective paid skill training is.

* Strength affects how well you hit enemies, how hard you hit, and your encumberance limit.

* Agility affects how well you dodge hits and how well you hide/steal.

* Willpower affects how well you mitigate psi damage.

* Constitution affects your chances of getting a higher HP rest (higher con = better rest).

* Constitution affects your chances of mitigating combat stuns.

* Intelligence gives better EP rests and EP regen to Mentalists and Fighter/Mentalists.

* Wisdom gives better EP rests and EP regen to Healers.

* Attacks gives you more rolls to determine how hard you hit with a melee attack (the highest roll is kept).

## Disciplines

* The Aid disc boosts your ability to hide, see through hide, and your melee to-hit rolls.

## Miscellaneous

* Different weapons carry different hide penalties. If you're holding a halberd, you're more likely to be seen than if you're holding a dagger.

* Any class can backstab and hide as if they were a thief, provided they have the requisite skill level.

* In addition to stripping, some lairs can eat. This is mostly creatures like dragons, FoodGuardian, and others. Getting eaten doesn't happen every time, but it can suck your XP and skills.

* You can be randomly stripped by monsters, they may rarely search your corpse for gear.
