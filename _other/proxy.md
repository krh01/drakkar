# Foreword

DrakProxy (Proxy for short) is one of the most controversial and complex tools available for Drakkar players.

If you don't know what it is, you probably don't need to know. If you know (or have it) and are trying to figure it out, well, I'm here to attempt to de-mystify it.

It's like Fight Club. The first rule about Proxy is don't talk about Proxy (publicly).

Anyway... Onwards!

## Menus
You can right click on the camel icon to get more options. 

### Menu Options

* Config
  * Launchers: This is where you go to add your accounts/characters. Pretty self-explanatory. You probably have a few pre-configured, depending on who you got Proxy from.
  * Scripts: This is where you go to set up character and class scripting. More on this later.
  * Slam Timer: This will kill all instances of the games in X minutes.
  * Substitutions: This will help you more effectively script where npc names are not constant. More on this later.
  * Save/Load config: Do this religiously, or you'll lose your configuration.
* View
  * Command Log: This will toggle the command log view. Useful to see what the game is actually doing.
  * Script Queue: This will show you the upcoming script actions. [note: I don't understand how this works, it doesn't seem to for me]
  * AutoProtter Status: This will show you AutoProtter. [note: I have never been able to understand how AutoProtter works]
  * Multiview (Quality): This will rearrange the windows and make the game looks nice.
  * Multiview (Speed): This will rearrange the windows and optimize them for game speed (useful on weaker computers).
  * Windows: All options in here are pretty self-explanatory and are mostly for concealing Draks existence on your machine, or saving your window arranagements. 
* Capture
  * Screenshot: This will take a screenshot of just the game (not the UI, etc)
  * Start/stop AVI recording: This will begin recording the game (neat for demoing lair fights)
  * Start/stop mapping: This will allow you to map out an area of the game. Useful for people making fansites.
* Scripting: These options are all displayed on the main interface and will be discussed later.

#### Substitutions
#### Scripting

## Main Screen
Here there is a lot to explain, there are a lot of categories and a lot of buttons. One main thing to understand is that you have to have a character highlighted in the "Active" box for any actions to take hold on them. You can select multiple by using shift and clicking, or select individuals by holding ctrl and clicking. Without further ado...

### Buttons
* Script: This toggles scripting on and off for a character. See above in "Scripts" for more info on what this means.
* Haste: I do not know. I assume it toggles who should get haste, or who gives haste.
* PWH: I believe this toggles PWH on and off for a particular character. The checkbox determines whether or not they should be PWHing at all.
* Clicky: This will "click" red targets on the screen. In combination with Substitutions, this is great.
* ByeB: "Bye Barb" supposedly this will click off barb tiers, but I've yet to get this to work.
* Rover: ???
* PWS: Toggle PWS on and off similar to PWH.
* Chase: Chase a particular character. I don't know how this works.
* ...: Clicking this is a shortcut to open Scripting.
* Reset Rnd: This will reset the round timer for scripting. As everything in the game is timing, this is useful to reset tiers.
* SetTarget, Clear, Text Box: This will let you set a target to automatically be appended to all your scripts. Useful on a boss.
* Commandline: This will allow you to send a command to all highlighted characters.

### Checkboxes
* Auto-Login: This will automatically log in and hit "play" for characters when you click on them in Launchers.
* Mirror All: This will mirror every command (incl. movement) that you send to a character. Not typically useful.
* Mirror Movement: This will mirror movement from one game instance to the other. Very useful to keep your party moving together.
* Mars Watch: Presumably will watch for Mars to show up in game and do something. I'm not sure specifically what this does.

### Active Box
This shows which characters you have logged in.

### Launchers Box
This shows all the characters you have set up.

### Recordings
I have no idea what this is or what it's for. Presumably it lets you make macros that involve mouse movement and the like.
