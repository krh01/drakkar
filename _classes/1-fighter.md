Fighter is a transient class. When good/good aligned, they can dedicate to the [Paladin](/classes/paladin) class. Otherwise, they can dedicate to the [Fighter/Mentalist](/classes/fighter-mentalist) class. Dedicating to Paladin is reversible (you simply have to lose alignment), but dedicating to Fighter/Mentalist is permanent.
