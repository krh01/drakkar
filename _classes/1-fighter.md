{% include base_path %}

Fighter is a transient class. When good/good aligned, they can dedicate to the [Paladin]({{ base_path }}/classes/paladin) class. Otherwise, they can dedicate to the [Fighter/Mentalist]({{ base_path }}/classes/fighter-mentalist) class. Dedicating to Paladin is reversible (you simply have to lose alignment), but dedicating to Fighter/Mentalist is permanent.

This class shares weapon specializations with the Paladin.
