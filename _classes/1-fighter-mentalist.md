{% include base_path %}

A combat/psionic hybrid. There are two ways to grow into this class:

* Start as a [Mentalist]({{ base_path }}/classes/mentalist), have more EP than normal, and the option to obtain energylance
* Start as a [Fighter]({{ base_path }}/classes/fighter), and be able to gain [weapon specializations]({{ base_path }}/other/weaponspecs)

Once you rest past experience level 20, you can no longer dedicate to this class.

These start weak, but get very powerful later on.
