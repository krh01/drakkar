{% include base_path %}

A combat/psionic hybrid. They get almost every Mentalist discipline, except for Elance. There are two ways to grow into this class:

* Start as a [Mentalist](/classes/mentalist), and have more EP than normal
* Start as a [Fighter](/classes/fighter), and be able to gain 3 weapon specializations (Fighter -> Paladin -> Fighter > Fighter/Mentalist)

Once you rest past experience level 20, you can no longer dedicate to this class.

These start weak, but get very powerful later on.
