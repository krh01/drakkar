6. frothing at the mouth

EXP Level | Description
--------- | -----------
1           | Barbarian can use `berserk`.

18          | +50% HP (gained entirely at `out of control`)
19          | Immune to the `scare` discipline at `frothing`.
20          | +4 Attacks (gained entirely at `out of control`)
21          | Immune to the `stun` discipline.
22          | +4 AGI (gained entirely at `frothing`)

Skill Level | Description
----------- | -----------
31          | Natural damage absorption is increased by half of the Barbarians level.
32          | Fully effective `cleave` doubles the combat effect on the target.
33          | STR/AGI/Attack bonus when fully zerked becomes +6/+6/+8.
34          | `cleave` no longer de-zerks the Barbarian, and instead applies a 50 round penalty to being used.
35          | Better at overcoming the deflection of other Barbarians.
36          | The "zerk" gained by using `berserk` is increased.
37          | Natural damage absorption is increased by the Barbarians level.
38          | "zerk" pool is doubled.
39          | Small chance of `primalstun` on hit.
