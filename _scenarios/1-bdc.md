{% include base_path %}

Black Dragon Consort (BDC) is considered an extension to [Nameless Lands]({{ base_path }}/scenarios/nl), thus sharing the same "alts" with it. You can enter from the southwest corner of GDH2 by talking to the Arbiter npc.

This place is mostly undesirable to hunt in due to armor breaks.

Needs more info.
