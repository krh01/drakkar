Aleria is a scenario that can be accessed at any level, provided you have Upper Guild Hall or a Ratburrow Sash. You can find Urmak, the Boatman, north of Ratburrow town in N3.5. Drop 1,000 gold and he'll give you a boat pass which you can use to travel to Aleria.

This land is a land where alignment matters, and was commonly used to help speed up the progress towards level 18. There are also lots of "Alerian Rare" items that can be found here, which used to be a source of bragging rights. People will typically farm Duke Talinar, Seldari Queen (and her zoo lair), Koss, and other big bosses for rares. They can drop anywhere and off of anything, but sometimes they are visible on the creatures you kill.

To get to Crazy Aleria, go to Kiara and say `kia, gocrazy`. You can gain primal skill here, and there are several good places to do so - caves, Seldari Queen's lair, Tarak's lair, and anywhere else with good respawn.

Beware the raids - sometimes the Duchy of Carrena will get raided by hundreds of goblins, ogres, etc. Most importantly, they dramatically cut respawn in other areas of the world so you may need to take a break to kill the raid.
