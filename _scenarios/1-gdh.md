Green Dragon Hatcheries (GDH) is considered an extension to [Nameless Lands](/scenarios/nl), thus sharing the same "alts" with it. You can enter by going to Jillian and saying `jil, gdh` when you're level 40.

The content starts at about level 40, but realistically you'll want to be level 60-70+ to make any meaningful progress. GDH is split into 3 parts, commonly referred to as GDH1, GDH2, and GDH3. You need to do progress quests to get from one to the next.
