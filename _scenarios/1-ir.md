Invader's Refuge (IR) is a dungeon-crawling expansion, sharing no alts with anything else (thus, it is standalone). In IR there are several new mechanics introduced, most of them revolving around the Arcane. While you can get in here as early as late-level-80s, it's recommended to be post-90, and at least in Silver SK armor (though most would prefer Green). To access this area, you need to get an Invader Scroll from Parapet, then talk to any Diplomat in NL. You'll get a new skill "Find Refuge" which you can use in NL anywhere to get into IR.

The dungeon starts easy and has approximately 25 difficulty scales.

## New Features

* Platinum Coins - These are obtained by searching corpses and looting Chests and Paintings. These cannot be dropped, but can be used to purchase from merchants in IR.

* Chests - These show up randomly in the dungeon, and can set off Traps. Most Traps will insta-kill you, so set twigs, teleports, and let you party get out of the way before you open them. You can get random items, Platinum, Arcane Points or Arcane Quirks from them.

* Paintings - These are like Chests, but appear on the walls.

* Tables - These are like Chests and Paintings, but appear on the floor.

* Arcane Abilities - These are like party abilities, but only apply to you. You can only start buying these at level 96+, but you can accrue points before that.

* Arcane Quirks - These are like normal quirks, but you can only start getting them at level 96.
