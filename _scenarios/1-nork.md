Nork is the scenario you start in. It has the school, lots of towns, deep dungeons, and plenty of world to explore.

It has a portal room where you can access the Guild Hall and it's natural Alt 2 (an enhanced version of Nork).

Holiday events are always held in Alt 2 Nork (requires a paid subscription).

There is also a "Primal" Nork that shows up periodically - it's incredibly tough end-game content where your gear doesn't matter, because you start fresh with whatever you can find in Primal Nork. That particular gear decays on a timer, and will actually poof. Gear here can also be found with random stats assigned to them, in many combinations.
