Silver Dragon Consort (SDC) is considered an extension to [Nameless Lands](/scenarios/nl), thus sharing the same "alts" with it. You can enter it by going to Jillian and saying `jil, sdc` at around level 40, but you'll want to be level 70+ before you do anything here.

SDC is where you'll do most of your leveling from 74ish to 85ish. You'll also be able to progress a bunch of primal quirks here, such as Air Head, Cavern Creeper, and Tree Hugger.
