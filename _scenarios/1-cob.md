{% include base_path %}

Cobrahn (formerly known as The Pit) is a scenario that can be accessed upon reaching level 18. There is a portal behind the Slicer lair in N-7 that will teleport you into the forest.

When you die here in normal cob, you lose 2 hp.

To get to Crazy Cob, go to Timmy Town and tell any blue npc `xxx, gocrazy`.
