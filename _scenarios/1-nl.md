{% include base_path %}

Nameless Lands is a rather large zone, potentially (depending on your playstyle) encompassing the majority of the levels played in Drakkar.

Nameless Lands has 2 alts:

* Alt 1 is what you expect, the "normal" experience.
* Alt 2 is available only to Platinum subscribers, is sped up compared to alt 1, monsters hit harder and AC scales differently, XP is doubled, and skill gain is increased. Overall it is a bit tougher.

Typically, you'll play here from somewhere between level 25 and 50 to level 70-75. Periodically, you'll want to visit [GDH]({{ base_path }}/scenarios/gdh/) to complete some quests, you can get in there starting at level 40. Once you've reached 74 or 75, you'll end up going to [SDC]({{ base_path }}/scenarios/sdc/) to continue your adventure.

Technically, all scenarios after Nameless Lands are considered to be a part of it (some places in SDC you can fall into the Bog, you can teleport between them, etc).
